# TOO Complex Todo App - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Just Want to Use the Todo App?

**The fastest way to run the working TodoLang application:**

```bash
node test-deployment.js
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8080**

## 📋 Server Options Summary

| Server Type | Command | URL | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|-----|---------|
| **Production** | `node test-deployment.js` | http://localhost:8080 | **Working todo app** |
| **Development** | `node dev-server.js` | http://localhost:3000 | Build status + links |
| **Static Files** | `cd deployment && python -m http.server 8080` | http://localhost:8080 | Direct file serving |

## 🎯 What Each Server Shows

### Production Server (`node test-deployment.js`)
- ✅ **Full working todo application**
- ✅ Add, edit, delete, filter todos
- ✅ Persistent storage
- ✅ URL routing
- ✅ All features functional

### Development Server (`node dev-server.js`)
- 📋 Shows "Production Ready" status page
- 🔗 Provides links to the actual working app
- 🛠️ Used during development workflow
- ⚠️ **Not the actual todo app** - just a status page

## 🔧 Build Commands

```bash
# Create production build
node scripts/build-production.js

# Validate deployment
node scripts/validate-deployment.js

# Run development build
node build.js --dev
```

## 🎉 The Bottom Line

- **Want to use the todo app?** → `node test-deployment.js`
- **Want to see build status?** → `node dev-server.js`
- **Want to develop?** → Use both servers as needed

The **actual working TodoLang todo application** is always served by the production server or by opening `deployment/index.html` directly!
